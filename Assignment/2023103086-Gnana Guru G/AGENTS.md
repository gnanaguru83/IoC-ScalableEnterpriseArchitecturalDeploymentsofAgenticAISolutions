# Read This First

At the beginning of each conversation, read [MANIFESTO.md](MANIFESTO.md) in the
repository root before doing anything else. It is the project's constitution: who
Backlog.md serves, its core loop, source of truth, surface hierarchy, interface posture,
design principles, boundaries, and risks. All architecture and product decisions must
align with it.

If a request appears to conflict with the manifesto, or would materially change a
principle in it, surface the conflict and ask Alex rather than silently proceeding. Do
not edit the manifesto as a side effect of implementation; changes to it require an
explicit product decision.

When you're working on a task, you should assign it yourself: -a @{your-name}

In addition to the rules above, please consider the following:
At the end of every task implementation, try to take a moment to see if you can simplify it. 
When you are done implementing, you know much more about a task than when you started.
At this point you can better judge retrospectively what can be the simplest architecture to solve the problem.
If you can simplify the code, do it.

## Simplicity-first implementation rules

- Prefer a single implementation for similar concerns. Reuse or refactor to a shared helper instead of duplicating.
- Keep APIs minimal. Favor load + upsert over load/save/update, and do not add unused methods.
- Avoid extra layers (services, normalizers, versioning) unless there is an immediate, proven need.
- Keep behavior consistent across similar stores (defaults, parse errors, locking). Divergence requires a clear reason.
- Don't add new exported helpers just to compute a path; derive from existing paths or add one shared helper only when reused.

## UI descriptions

Do not add subtitles, helper text, or descriptive copy beneath headings, labels, cards, or settings by default. Prefer
one concise, self-explanatory heading or label. Only add supporting copy when the user explicitly asks for it or when it
is necessary to prevent misunderstanding or error, and never use it to restate the heading.


## Commands

### Development

- `bun i` - Install dependencies
- `bunx tsc --noEmit` - Type-check code
- `bun run check .` - Run all Biome checks (format + lint)
- `bun run build` - Build the CLI tool
- `bun run cli` - Uses the CLI tool directly

### Testing

- `bun run test` - Run all tests (applies the same test timeout CI uses)
- `bun test --timeout=10000 <filename>` - Run specific test file

### Configuration Management

- `bun run cli config list` - View all configuration values
- `bun run cli config get <key>` - Get a specific config value (e.g. defaultEditor)
- `bun run cli config set <key> <value>` - Set a config value with validation

## Core Structure

- **CLI Tool**: Built with Bun and TypeScript as a global npm package (`npm i -g backlog.md`)
- **Source Code**: Located in `/src` directory with modular TypeScript structure
- **Task Management**: Uses markdown files in `backlog/` directory structure
- **Workflow**: Git-integrated with task IDs referenced in commits and PRs

## Agent POV

- Treat Backlog.md as a shipped CLI/MCP binary that may be used from other repositories where agents cannot inspect this source tree.
- Backlog.md is not a supported JavaScript or TypeScript library API for external consumers. Do not treat exported source symbols, classes, or methods in `/src` as stable public interfaces unless they are explicitly documented in shipped CLI/MCP/instruction surfaces.
- Use only the stable public surface—CLI behavior, MCP tools/resources and schemas,
  configuration, CLI help, and shipped instruction files—when deciding what external
  agents can rely on or evaluating compatibility. Internal TypeScript exports are
  implementation details unless public docs explicitly promise them.
- Do not assume external agents know internal implementation details, constants, or source-only conventions.
- When reviewing changes, do not ask for compatibility shims just because a source-level method exists or was removed. Only preserve compatibility for behavior that is part of the documented CLI, MCP, config, or instruction contract.
- If a convention matters for agent behavior, document it in the public MCP/instruction surface rather than relying on source-code discovery.

## Maintainer Workflow Guardrails

- Treat GitHub issues as reports, proposals, or evidence, not implementation specs. Do not automatically implement the requested solution; first evaluate whether the change fits Backlog.md's public CLI/MCP/instruction surface and current documented behavior.
- Escalate ambiguous product behavior to Alex before implementation. For example, pause before deciding whether ordinal-only task ordering changes should update edit metadata.
- PRs should normally link to a scoped issue first. If a broad feature PR or request has no issue, ask for an issue or discussion before implementation rather than turning the PR into the scope definition.
- Investigations should not create implementation PRs by default. Leave findings as comments, reports, or notes unless a narrow accepted fix is clear.
- Use the documented `backlog task create` workflow for task creation. Do not manually edit task files, pick IDs, pre-reserve IDs, or create coordination-only IDs as a workaround; rely on the CLI allocator and lock to assign task IDs.
- When acting publicly on Alex's behalf, use neutral maintainer language and identify yourself as `Alex's Agent:` if identification is needed. Do not reveal private strategy, roadmap, or status framing; keep scope decisions grounded in the project's public docs and shipped behavior.

## Code Standards

- **Runtime**: Bun with TypeScript 5
- **Formatting**: Biome with tab indentation and double quotes
- **Linting**: Biome recommended rules
- **Testing**: Bun's built-in test runner
- **Pre-commit**: Husky + lint-staged automatically runs Biome checks before commits

The pre-commit hook automatically runs `biome check --write` on staged files to ensure code quality. If linting errors
are found, the commit will be blocked until fixed.

## Git Workflow

- **Branching**: Use feature branches when working on tasks (e.g. `tasks/back-123-feature-name`)
- **Committing**: Use the following format: `BACK-123 - Title of the task`
- **PR titles**: Use `{taskId} - {taskTitle}` (e.g. `BACK-123 - Title of the task`)
- **Github CLI**: Use `gh` whenever possible for PRs and issues

## Backlog.md Workflow

This project uses Backlog.md for task and project management.

**At the beginning of each conversation in this project, run `backlog instructions overview` before answering or taking action. Re-read it only if you have not read it yet in the current conversation.**

Use the overview to decide whether to search, read, create, or update Backlog tasks.

Before task lifecycle actions, read the matching detailed guide:
- `backlog instructions task-creation` before creating or splitting tasks
- `backlog instructions task-execution` before planning, changing status or assignee, adding a plan or implementation notes, or implementing task work
- `backlog instructions task-finalization` before checking acceptance criteria, writing final summaries, or moving tasks to terminal statuses

Use `backlog <command> --help` before running unfamiliar commands. Help shows options, fields, and examples.

Do not edit Backlog task, draft, document, decision, or milestone markdown files directly. Use the `backlog` CLI so metadata, relationships, and history stay consistent.
